# How will it work?

_Alternative title: 'Koppeltaal Server environments for integration development'_

Koppeltaal offers different environments to support in the processes of integrating your application from development to production.

The version of Koppeltaal Server that each environment is running will vary. Depending on the progress of the next Koppeltaal release some environments may have been updated to the latest version. In general, no environment will be more than one minor version behind. No environment will run an older version than the production environment.

## Development and testing your application

For development for third parties, Koppeltaal offers three environments:

* **Edge** The latest stable build of the Koppeltaal Server. Connecting applications can preview the latest features and bugfixes here.

  [https://edgekoppeltaal.vhscloud.nl](https://edgekoppeltaal.vhscloud.nl)

* **Next** The upcoming Koppeltaal Server version. This will generally be the version of Koppeltaal Server that is undergoing acceptance tests. If there is currently no new version being accepted this version will be identical to the production version.

  [https://nextkoppeltaal.vhscloud.nl](https://nextkoppeltaal.vhscloud.nl)

* **Stable** The version of the Koppeltaal Server currently in production.

  [https://stablekoppeltaal.vhscloud.nl](https://stablekoppeltaal.vhscloud.nl)

## Acceptation

These environments are used to accept connectors and clients before a Koppeltaal Server release:

* **Connectors** Used to perform the Koppeltaal connector acceptance tests. [https://connectorskoppeltaal.vhscloud.nl](https://connectorskoppeltaal.vhscloud.nl)
* **Clients** Used to perform your application \(Koppeltaal client\) acceptance tests.

## Production

The live environment can be found at [https://prd.koppeltaal.nl](https://prd.koppeltaal.nl).

## Support

Koppeltaal consumers can use the [ticket system](https://koppeltaal.nl/k2-categories/support/support-console) to report bugs, questions and domain/application registration requests. In order to get access to the ticket system you will need to have an [Koppeltaal account](https://koppeltaal.nl/koppeltaal/user-registration).

Koppeltaal Support will monitor the tickets and act upon them to add the correct handler on it and monitor the status. In order to maintain continuity Koppeltaal Support will also have a weekly key performance indicator report of the status of the tickets, this report will be sent via e-mail. If you are interested in getting this weekly e-mail, contact Koppeltaal Support.
